    "# Convolutional Neural Network Assignment: Image Classification on CIFAR 10\n",
    "In this assignment, you will design and implement a CNN model using the Keras deep learning framework. You will use the CIFAR-10 dataset which has 50,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. You will initially only use the first 5,000 training examples for **training**. Use the last 1,000 training examples for **validation** and the first 1,000 test examples for **testing**. Please complete the rest of the code by doing following tasks.\n",
    "- Build your network. Your network should have **at least** 2 convolutional layers, 1 max pooling layer and 1 fully connected layer.\n",
    "- Use Keras to train your network. You need\n",
    "    1. Describe the hyperparameters you use and their values. \n",
    "    2. Try different gradient descent optimization technique: **SGD, Adam, RMSprop**\n",
    "- Plot the following for each optimization method:\n",
    "    1. Validation loss vs. number of iterations(i.e., passes through the dataset)\n",
    "    2. Validation accuracy vs. number of iterations\n",
    "- Is there any difference among the plots of the three optimization methods?\n",
    "- Report a final test result on the 1000 examples.\n",
    "- Give detailed explanation of your code, your architecture, any options. \n",
    "- Bonus: we are training on a very small subset of CIFAR 10, so it is easy to overfit. Here are some tips you may try for improving your model's performance:\n",
    "    - Go deeper: adding more convolutional layers to your model\n",
    "    - Increase the complexity: adding more filters in the layers\n",
    "    - Use more training example \n",
